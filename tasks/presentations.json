However, it is a well-known problem that complex HQL queries, with many joins across class hierarchies, may perform very poorly, especially if executed on large databases. In such cases, Hibernate developers often escape to native SQL, giving up the object perspective and compactness of queries. Complex SQL queries are, however, cumbersome and difficult to maintain. FastOQL solves this problem by producing optimal SQL queries with a minimal number of joins from object queries. FastOQL is a Java library that compiles OQL (Object Query Language) queries into efficient SQL queries. It is designed to work with Hibernate, as an alternative to its HQL, to address its performance and scalability problems. If the domain model has inheritance hierarchies and/or collections mapped to association tables, FastOQL can bring substantial performance benefits.","tags":[{"name":"ORM"},{"name":"performance"},{"name":"Hibernate"},{"name":"sql"}],"speaker":"Žarko Mijailović","track":"Java EE","type":"Tools in Action","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"https://staging-cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/2003","speaker":"Žarko Mijailović","speakerId":2003},{"speakerUri":"https://staging-cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/2002","speaker":"Srđan Luković","speakerId":2002},{"speakerUri":"https://staging-cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/58","speaker":"Dragan Milicev","speakerId":58}],"id":1932,"title":"FastOQL - Fast Object Queries for Hibernate","speakerUri":"https://staging-cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/2003","speakerId":2003,"experience":"NOVICE","language":"en","room":"Room 4"},{"summary":"In this session we will provide an introduction to the Scala programming language, a language that fuses object oriented programming with functional programming.\r\n\r\nThe session will cover topics including (time permitting):\r\n\r\n* Using the Scala REPL\r\n* Control structures in Scala (while, if, try)\r\n* Type inference\r\n* Classes, Objects and Traits\r\n* Function Literals and Closures\r\n* Introduction to the Scala collections API\r\n* Avoiding nulls\r\n* For expressions\r\n* Approaching functional programming in Scala","tags":[{"name":"scala"}],"speaker":"Dick Wall","track":"JVM Languages","type":"University","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"https://staging-cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/272","speaker":"Dick Wall","speakerId":272},{"speakerUri":"https://staging-cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/273","speaker":"Bill Venners","speakerId":273}],"id":2061,"title":"First steps with Scala","speakerUri":"https://staging-cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/272","speakerId":272,"experience":"NOVICE","language":"en","room":"Room 9"},{"summary":"Great user experience requires buttery smoothness in rendering and animating your interface; your app must have a good, consistent frame rate.

They choose Scala as a compelling alternative for the Java language itself. Amongst its many qualities, Scala runs on the JVM, introduces many interesting new language concepts, and makes it relatively easy to reuse existing Java code. None of the qualities are unique to Scala per se, but the fact remains that Scala is getting more and more interest, perhaps because of its type-safe nature (as opposed to the many dynamic language alternatives available on the JVM).\r\n\r\nIn this session, we introduce the Spring Scala project, aimed at making it easier to use Spring in Scala.
